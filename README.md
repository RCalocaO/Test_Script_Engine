# Test_Script_Engine
Last semester of university's Compilers II project: real-time rendering engine using DJGPP/Allegro, with a world script file and a behavior script, which could be modified at runtime.

**Heavily** based off Crystal Space engine, circa May 2000 :)

Got it compiling under VS 2017, had to disable all the Allegro code for now. More interested in it as time capsule!

Also had to fix tons of C++-ism that no longer fly in 2019.
